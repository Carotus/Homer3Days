# Description

"3 days left to live" is a short game about existentialism and the meaning of life. The game is divided in 2 phases: One in which you talk with NPCs to confront your views and obtain items, and another one in which you need to survive the harsh environments of the mountain

# Synopsis

You live in a small town close to a mountain. The outside environment is hostile, so living beyond the walls that guard the city means certain death. In your culture, it's illegal to kill someone, even if it's to punish a murderer. Murderers, instead of receiving the death penalty, are exiled after 3 days from their sentence. In these 3 days, prisoners receive visits from different "entities" called "bearers", which can both provide closure and bring gifts. You were framed for a horrible crime, and are sentenced to exile. In the following days, you will receive the visits. After that, you'll have to survive on your own. How will you deal with such an awful situation?
